2. Experience

Please explain your current experience related to the job
description you are nominated for. Please cover relevant
management training and experience. (Including: soft skills,
conflict resolution, leadership, and inter-cultural interactions).
Describe your experience working in diverse environments.

[2] I would summarize my experience in technical and non-technical
categories as follows.

[ Technical ]

- I've been a regular IETF participant since first attending IETF 70 in
  December 2007 (originally in order to participate in 6man).

- I have co-authored only two published IETF RFCs (RFCs 6564, 8910), one
  Independent Stream document (RFC 8805), and have been cited in the
  Acknowledgments section of, at most, about a dozen others.

- I was co-chair of ART area's capport working group from early 2017 until
  its closing in 2020 and was a Gen-ART reviewer from early 2018 until
  the beginning of service as an INT AD in March 2020.

- I have a moderate amount of experience implementing several key IETF
  Internet Area technologies, including:

    - From 2007 through 2014, I wrote much of the IPv6 support in
      Google infrastructure.  This included IPv6 in core C++ and Java
      networking libraries, the HTTP frontend, the YouTube streamer,
      authoritative DNS, Google's NTP service, and the IPv6 serving and
      recursing support in the Public DNS service. I also wrote the
      DNS64 implementation in the Google Public DNS service.  When the
      Google datacenter wanted to start moving to IPv6-only I helped
      design and develop the first proof-of-concept for /64 to the host
      with per-process IP addressing and ILNP-inspired mobility (this
      work was advanced by others [Lorenzo Colitti, Tom Herbert,
      et al.] and became ILA).

    - During this time I also co-authored the design, implementation,
      and paper summarizing Google's IPv6 measurements, which still
      powers google.com/ipv6 public statistics (see the Scholar page:

        https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1yKwJWAAAAAJ

      for links to the measurements paper).

    - From 2014 to 2018 as a member of this Android Core Networking
      team I implemented things like IPv6 tethering support (using RFC 7278,
      a.k.a. 64share), and a dynamic RA daemon that responds to changes
      in upstream connectivity, deprecating prefixes appropriately).  I
      was involved in the Android PVD architecture implementation
      (including a handful of Linux kernel fixes to support this),
      handled some minor NTP support issues, wrote some ARP/ND -driven
      network measurement and monitoring, and was also the tech lead
      for the "Private DNS" project, adding DNS-over-TLS (RFC 7858)
      support into the core platform:

        https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/dns-over-tls-support-in-android-p.html

    - From 2018 to early 2021 I served as a network architect and
      member of the Minkowski TS-SDN team for Loon's network (chapter 4, The
      Loon Library PDF, https://x.company/projects/loon/the-loon-collection/).
      This involved network orchestration of an IPv6-only network and
      implementation of a MANET-style protocol for one of the balloon
      control plane layers.  I also helped produce a detailed network
      architecture for a satellite mesh network.

[ Non-technical ]

- I have been a manager of technical teams on three separate occasions.
  There was some training at the time, but the primary focus was on the
  legal implications and responsibilities and not on soft skills of any
  real value, regrettably.

  Each managerial experience eventually involved some hard
  conversations with employees including two dismissals and one
  investigation for possible theft of company property.

  As such, for the past twenty years I've focused on individual
  technical contribution, often in a role providing technical
  leadership and architectural vision.

- I have collaborated with numerous teams on technical objectives,
  both within Alphabet and outside it.

  Most memorable for me was helping found and participating in the
  organization of the ISOC-led World IPv6 Day (2011) and World IPv6
  Launch (2012) events. Both involved coordinating internal legal and
  technical approval and interactions with other like-minded folks
  doing the same coordination at Yahoo, Facebook, Akamai, Cisco,
  Microsoft, and others.

- Most directly relevant to the role of INT AD would be, I suppose, my
  ongoing experience as INT AD.  There have been, and continue to be,
  some contentious issues to be addressed.  Often times there's much more
  to the story than want appears in the email archive.  My preferred
  approach may be a little exhausting for some, but I do best when I can
  have 1:1 or small group video chats to hear out everyone's perspectives.
  These discussions usually start with introductory questions and lots of
  listening, but I'm never finished until I've engaged in some Socratic
  questioning.  I usually try to ask how folks respond to the various
  (counter-)arguments that have been raised, and we often get into some
  interpretation of relevant text.  While I aim to always make the best
  decision I can, it must at least be one that is as clearly articulated
  and defensible as I can manage -- even if no parties are ultimately happy
  with the outcome.

==================================================================

3. Participation, Diversity, and Mentoring

What would you do to improve participation in the IETF? What would
you do to improve the diversity of participation? What would you do to
help prepare the next group of leaders in the IETF?

[3] I take every opportunity to encourage folks who might have an
IETF-addressable issue to consider participation.  I try to ease them in
by suggesting a presentation in a suitable dispatch group, where applicable.
I offer to personally help get them set up with document writing if/after
they've warmed up to the overall idea of participation.  Within Google I'm
listed as one contact person for anyone curious about IETF things, and have
fielded a handful of inquiries during my term.  During this time of COVID
lock-down, however, it's been difficult to meet and invite a broader set of
folks: the general effect has been to restrict communication to those with
whom I had previously communicated.

Mentoring begins, on an individual level, with respectfully helping
someone understand:

    - the Tao of the IETF (its importance matches its length),

    - the values of the IETF (per the RFC 3935 mission statement, the
      IETF is not value-neutral), which should include mention of
      RFC 8890 ("The Internet is for End Users"), and

    - the architectural principles of the Internet (cf. RFC 1958).

Ideally, I feel those who would be leaders are those with actual
implementation experience.  (Operating a network of moderate complexity
is important, but not necessarily sufficient for the INT area.)  The
hackathon is a great opportunity for someone to get a start, and there
are generally several opportunities to contribute to open source
projects.  All this should be encouraged, and it seems natural to look
to these groups for emergent leaders.

Lastly, I think that leaders in the IETF need a healthy respect for the
scope and impact of the work, and the capacity to listen, learn, and update
their priors.  I'm not sure how to engender this in others, but there
can be no doubt that it begins by modeling it.

==================================================================

4. IETF

How can the value of the IETF to internal and broader technical
community be improved (please comment on culture, operations, or
other topics)?

[4] The IETF has some of the most easily searchable and navigable
documents of any SDO. There is a plethora of text on technical,
cultural, and organizational matters that is freely available to read with
any number of simple tools -- all easily indexed, no subscription or
membership required nor fees of any kind, just basic Internet access.

However, one thing that can be quite daunting for anyone trying to
familiarize themselves with an area is often the absence of a framework
for organizing all the documents conceptually.  The publication of the
Tao as a web page provides a nice, coherent introduction to numerous
RFCs about the IETF itself.  Similarly, the effort that went in to
squashing all the RFCs, updates, and errata into RFC 8200 (for the
purposes of publishing a standards document) served to form a single
entry point for someone new to and interested in the technical details
of IPv6 (though not, perhaps, matters of policy).  As long as it doesn't
negatively impact other work or the community itself to do, I'm usually
in favor this kind of thing (consider, for example, how someone wanting to
write a DNS implementation from scratch -- for whatever reason -- would go
about wading through all the DNS RFCs to figure out how best to proceed).

To be more inclusive of newcomers requires more than these kinds of
technological assistance.  Inclusivity improves both by inviting others
into your community and meeting others in their communities.  The BoF
process and, even better, the ${AREA}-dispatch work groups are good
fora into which to invite folks who want to figure out how to solve a
particular problem and perhaps thereafter join the larger community.
Wider circulation of these and related opportunities is great, and I
frequently share links to YouTube recordings.

As for meeting others in their communities, I think it is incumbent upon
us to articulate a solid argument for bringing work to the IETF.  It's not
uncommon to overhear someone decrying the lack of speed of the process or
bemoaning anticipated obstructionism.  Though the process can be
difficult, the value of scrutiny by the diversity of implementers and
operators is something to uphold.  The articulation of how and why
work brought to the IETF became better as a consequence (think: QUIC)
is an important message to bring other communities in order to keep new
ideas and new people flowing into the IETF community.

=============================================================

5. IESG

Please explain your understanding and ability to support the work
load associated with the position. Explain the value you will
bring to the role and how it will help enhance the mission of the
IETF. Explain your view of the purpose of IESG review and how
you intend to approach it. How would you plan to manage the
working groups in your nominated area?
Please provide an assessment of the area for which you were
nominated.

[5] RFC 3710 sets out a charter for the IETF, describing numerous
functions including working group life-cycle management, IETF document
review and handling for both working group and non-working-group
documents, as well as other process management and appeals/conflict
resolution responsibilities.

Having sat on the IESG for one term so far one very important function
is to serve as insurance that at least a minimum number of IETF community
members have read any given document.  Having a fair understanding of INT
area topics, and a broad though cursory understanding of others, I always
aim to read and assimilate the fundamental intent of each document.

The job also entails coordinating with other ADs on handling appeals and
discussing any cross-area issues that might need AD resolution or, at a
minimum, careful observation and perhaps a word or two of guidance.  In
this regard, I have found it useful to work via shared Google documents that
can be edited by many people and link to any and all supporting (or
contradictory) text.

The working groups for which I'm currently responsible are in a variety
of states.  Some have reached the point where they need to be rechartered
while others probably need to be closed.  Some have long-held divisions
that I would like to see addressed, at least in part if not wholly solved.
Still other groups are largely quiet.  COVID lock-down and broad travel
restrictions have, in my opinion, had a noticeable effect on INT area groups
(though perhaps it's the noticeable effect on myself that I'm really
observing): those that already worked well remotely continue to do so while
others, lacking direct interpersonal contact haven't been able to generate
much activity or haven't been able to generate new shared understanding.

=============================================================

6. Cross-IETF Collaboration

Explain how your role will fit into the IETF as a whole and how
you will add value.

[6] INT Area Directors are responsible for working groups that cover
a wide range of technical topics at Layer 3 and, colloquially, "Layer 3
adjacent".  Finding experts for review of documents that come from
within the INT area and elsewhere is an important part of the role,
as is serving as one of these reviewers.  Additionally, being open and
available for consultation on the wide range of INT area topics is critical
(certainly I bent Suresh's ear on no end of issues).  Also, there are the
INT and IoT directorates within INT AD purview (presently, these are
very well managed by their chairs :-).

Another aspect of the role is keeping an eye on activities within the
broader IETF (other working groups, BoFs, ...), the IRTF, as well as the
general Internet standards space for anything that might be of interest or
relevance to INT area working groups.  This can be things like making sure
to solicit community feedback as necessary for conflict reviews of
Independent stream/IRTF documents.  Even watching out for assumptions
made about Layer 3 technologies by other SDOs (IEEE, 3GPP, ...) and bringing
it to the attention of interested INT working groups as needed can be an
important aspect of the role.

It's important for INT ADs to keep an eye out for developing issues that
might be organized into a BoF.  Similarly, some long-standing issues may
evolve to a point where they can be either redressed or at least sufficiently
well articulated in a document.  Discussing and finding authors within the
IETF (or soliciting others to join) for such efforts can be a useful function
of the role as well.
