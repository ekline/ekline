This questionnaire is intended to provide the Nominating Committee (NomCom)
with information to help select among nominees for the position of
INT Area Director.

FORMAT: We ask that you provide us with a response in English using a plain
text format (Unicode is OK) wrapped to 77 columns. Please avoid email
attachments; our system doesn't handle these well.

CONFIDENTIALITY: The contents of this questionnaire will remain absolutely
confidential to the NomCom and the confirming body (the IAB).
If you are chosen for a position, the confirming body may see your responses.
The section of this questionnaire labeled NOT FOR CONFIRMING BODY will not be
provided to the confirming body; it will only be shared with the NomCom.

POSITION: In answering, please consider the desired expertise for the
INT Area Director position that can be found at the following url:

==================================================================

Area Director Position

Please explain your understanding of the role, its responsibilities, and
its associated workload.

------------------------------------------------------------------

As INT AD, the role mostly consists of reviewing documents in the area
(especially in the working groups for which the AD is responsible),
shepherding them through IETF Last Call and IESG telechat review, and through
the final stages with the RFC Editor. Fostering new work in the area is also
important, which usually means reviewing proposals (written and verbal) and
charting possible next steps.

Outside of INT there is general coordination with other areas and working
groups to review and resolve any issues arising from intersecting concerns.
This includes dispute review and resolution (if possible).  Additionally,
the INT layer can have many interactions with other SDOs (e.g. "lower layers"
used to provide Internet access like 3GPP and IEEE, but sometimes other
organizations like the W3C).

ADs, as members of the IESG, participate in additional functions like
conflict reviews, BoF reviews, and several other activities in service to
the community.

The workload is mostly reading 200-400 pages of text every two weeks.  The
really time-consuming parts are: technical dispute resolution (especially
appeals), coordination with non-IETF groups, and trying to deal with soft
skill things in the hope of making the IETF perceived as decreasingly toxic.

==================================================================

Your Area

Please provide your thoughts/perspective on the state of the area for
which you were nominated. What would you hope to accomplish as AD and
how? How would your skills and experience complement those of your
fellow AD(s)? If you are an incumbent, please include your assessment of
your performance here.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The INT area is a mix of (a) general quiet, I think reflecting some overall
maturity at this layer, (b) some fixes and extensions to keep things moving
forward, and (c) repetition of discussions that have failed to gather
consensus sufficient to see the issue not brought up again.

Some of the long-standing disagreements have had slowly refined arguments
and every once in a while a minor breakthrough might be made.  The main
goal here as an AD has been to maintain a civil process and not try to
drive parties to any conclusions (these disagreements are sometimes
doctrinal in nature).

I have generally tried to remain silent on some of the more vocal discussions
until explicitly called upon.  When responding, I've found myself drafting
text as if it were to be attacked by a horde of language lawyers.  Trying to
get wording just right has made me extremely slow to respond some times.

I think there could be more support for some newer work or some thinking
that's a bit outside the norm if authors and working groups would lean more
heavily on Experimental as a document status.  This is something I have
mentioned a few times but could probably be more proactive about raising.

==================================================================

Experience

Describe any relevant management experience. Describe any technical
experience relevant to the area for which you are nominated.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I would refer the committee to the Experience sections from my applications
for the 2020-2022 term:

and the 2022-2024 term:

  * https://github.com/ekline/ekline/blob/main/ietf_iesg_int_ad_2022_application.txt

==================================================================

Participation, Diversity, and Mentoring

Describe your perspective on what diversity should mean for the IETF, and
the degree to which existing IETF participation meets those
expectations. What have you done in the past to encourage participation
by those who might otherwise not have considered engaging with the IETF?

------------------------------------------------------------------

Broadly, I think diversity for the IETF means that the community should
reflect a technically capable sample of all who might use the Internet
(i.e., everyone).  Not all ideas are of equal merit, but anyone wishing
"to make the Internet work better" should feel welcome to participate.

After four years on the IESG, observing some of the behavior on mailing
lists (and sometimes having to coordinate and communicate a public response
to some behavior), I think the most important thing to focus on first is to
not allow "loud men talking loudly" [LOUD] to use their "loudness" as a means
to shut down other voices.  It is important to tread carefully, though, but
the non-public response suggests there is often more support than might
otherwise be visible.  I suspect that focusing on "tending the garden" will
allow space to foster "new growth".  And, of course, I need to remember to
not be one those "talking loudly" myself.

==================================================================

IETF

What should the IETF do to make the Internet better? What would you do to
facilitate that? How will you encourage new work and talent coming into
the IETF?

------------------------------------------------------------------

Much of what should be done to make the Internet work better amounts to
staying the course, e.g. continue to authenticate and encrypt "all the
things" traffic, advance federated identity efforts, improve protocols
for permissionless network extension, etc.

But we shouldn't overlook the impact that increasing diversity (see above)
is likely to have on the IETF's ability to improve the Internet for all
users, current and future.  Aiming to keep one open and unfragmented Internet
growing in scale, is going to require a broad collection of perspectives.

At this point, my own focus on this is to try to make new folks feel welcome
and help frame proposed work in such a was that it can get review and
feedback from the most relevant subgroups in the community.

==================================================================

Why do you think NomCom should select you for this role?

------------------------------------------------------------------

The NomCom should probably choose from other candidates, if such selection
works out. I'm willing to serve a 3rd term but in general would prefer to
get back to being an individual contributor.

==================================================================

Additional Information

If there is any additional information you wish to share with the
Nominating Committee and the confirming body (the IAB), please
put it here.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I think a 3rd term would likely involve me employing some time-saving tactics
like reducing document reviews to focusing mostly on INT-area impact rather
than attempting more thorough readings.

==============================================================

NOT FOR CONFIRMING BODY

Additional Information - For NomCom Only

If there is there any additional information you wish to share with the
Nominating Committee that will NOT be shared with the confirming body
(the IAB), please put it here. This may include any of: personal
identifying information, include additional details about employment or
work time issues, opinions or comments on individuals on the various
bodies involved in leading the IETF activities, opinions about the
direction of working groups, areas, or leadership bodies, and the
like. These comments may also include elaborations on any of your above
answers, if there are further aspects you would like to mention that you
do not want shared outside of NomCom.
